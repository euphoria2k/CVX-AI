# Abstract
Safety and maintaining order in society are two factors that make the world safe. This is made possible because of laws. Despite this, crime exists due to lawbreakers. Law enforcement agencies are interested in identifying and locating these persons of interest (POI). Descriptive details of potential suspects help find POI. Useful descriptions come from eyewitnesses present at the scene. Remembering details can be problematic with short-term memory since crucial details may be forgotten. Eyewitness accounts are not always the same, because every individual remembers events differently. Sometimes, extra details are added unintentionally. The purpose of this project is to make the identification of POIs more reliable and efficient with emphasis on privacy.
